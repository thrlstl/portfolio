        <p>
            I'm a Software Engineer and design-thinker 
            motivated to improve lives through people-first solutions. 
            I'm also a former sales professional, Queer/Gay Man in Tech, 
            Graphic Designer, Writer, Mariah Carey aficionado, life-long learner, 
            and much more!
        </p>

            I began my professional career in health and wellness, 
            acting as a resource and liaison for people seeking to improve 
            their lives. Iâ€™ve always been guided by my desire to help people and 
            create changeâ€”which motivated me to continue learning and pursue a 
            career in technology and development.
        </p>

            Most recently, I completed Flatiron School's Software Engineering 
            immersive, expanding my practice in the following areas: collaborative 
            coding in a feedback-driven environment, object-oriented programming, 
            delivering high-quality solutions in rapid iterations, and handcrafting 
            UI components for enhanced user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I volunteer my time with Code for Americaâ€™s Chicago chapter 
            and Code The Dream to help our underserved communities while continuing 
            to learn and grow as an engineer. I'm eager to build with a team that 
            celebrates my identity, values my unique contributions, and empowers a 
            diverse workforce.
